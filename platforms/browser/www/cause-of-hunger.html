            <p>El Nino is an event of unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years. The occurrence of El Nino leads to changes in rainfall and temperature, affecting agriculture produce and animal husbandry that worsen global food insecurity. Natural disasters such as floods, tropical storms, and prolonged droughts have become more frequent. Drought is one of the key contributors to global food insecurity, causing serious impact on the hungry people. With signs that it might be one of the fiercest El Ninos in over three decades, its impact would spread across Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia, and Central America in late 2015 until early 2016, hitting vulnerable people whose livelihood rely on farming and livestock.</p>
            <p>Under the effect of climate change, commodity prices in grain-producing countries could fluctuate. Communities already living in poverty may not managed to have enough food. To cope with the situation, some families may sell all their possessions, eat only one to two meals a day, or pull children out of school.</p>

        <div data-role="nd2tab" data-tab="conflict">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/conflict.jpg" />
            <p>Conflicts around the world disrupt farming and food production. Consistent fighting also forces millions of people to flee their homes, leading to hunger emergencies as they could not find a way to feed themselves. The Syria refugee crisis is a recent example.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, food itself becomes a weapon. Soldiers will starve opponents into submission by seizing or destroying food and livestock and systematically wrecking local markets. Fields and water wells are often mined or contaminated, forcing farmers to abandon their land.</p>

            <p>People living in poverty cannot afford to buy nutritious food to feed themselves and their families. When they are hungry, they lack the strength and ability to work. In developing countries, impoverished farmers do not have the money to buy seeds, or tools and fertilisers to grow sufficient food for their families.</p>
            <p>Hunger could not be eradicated overnight: when children are chronically malnourished or stunted, it can affect their future, condemning them to a lifelong cycle of poverty and hunger.</p>
